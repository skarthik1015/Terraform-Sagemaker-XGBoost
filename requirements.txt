# Python Dependencies for SageMaker MLOps Pipeline

# Core ML and Data Science
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
xgboost>=1.7.0

# AWS SDK and SageMaker
boto3>=1.28.0

# FIX: was sagemaker>=2.180.0 which was resolving to sagemaker 3.4.1 on the
# GitHub Actions runner. sagemaker 3.x is a completely different package rewrite
# that dropped sagemaker.image_uris and other v2 submodules our pipeline depends
# on (Estimator, HyperparameterTuner, Pipeline workflow, etc.).
# Pinning <3.0.0 keeps us on the v2 SDK where everything works as expected.
sagemaker>=2.180.0,<3.0.0

# Utilities
python-dateutil>=2.8.2
pytz>=2023.3
